## Search Twitter

Type in a word, select a language (only spanish and english supported), and see what people in Twitter are saying about it.

## About

When you submit a search, a Python function hosted as an AWS lambda serverless function is triggered to use the Twitter Search API, collect the ~500 most recent tweets that meet the criteria (i.e. use the given word), and return a clean list of all the words used in the tweets (removing punctuation, common stopwords and the given word itself). Then, I plot a bubble chart with the counts of each word using the [nivo](https://nivo.rocks/bubble/) data viz library for React---which I hadn't used before and really liked.

I made it as an exercise to learn more about serverless functions---taking advantage of the twitter search python code I had written and covered previously in [this spanish post](/scraping-twitter-with-python)). I hadn't made serverless functions before, and really wanted to see how I could use them to integrate Python code (which I'm most familiar with and would like to continue using for data science stuff) with frontend development frameworks like React. The process was made pretty smooth thanks to [the python-lambda package](https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda), and my only struggle was figuring out the CORS issues (short story: handle OPTIONS request as part of the function's logic). I'd like to make a follow up post to this one with the "making off', so stay tuned!

I think there's a lot of cool stuff you can do with this approach, and I'm interested to hear your opinions in the comments. I'd like to train a text classifier with [spaCy](https://spacy.io), something like giving users the ability to search for a term and have the model classify the results into buckets like positive-neutral-negative, politics-sports-tech-other, etc. I don't think it would take much more than what I did here, except spending a couple hours hand labeling tweets ðŸ¤¯.

Tell me what you think!
