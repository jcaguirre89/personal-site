## Search Twitter

Type in a word, select a language (only spanish and english supported), and see what people in Twitter are saying about it.

## About

When you submit a search, a Python function hosted as an AWS lambda serverless function is triggered that uses the Twitter Search API to collect the ~500 most recent tweets (maximum history available is ~7 days) that meet the criteria, i.e. use the given word in the given language, and return a clean list of all the individual words (or _tokens_) used in the tweets---removing punctuation, common stopwords and the given word itself. Then, I plot a bubble chart with the counts of each word using the [nivo](https://nivo.rocks/bubble/) data viz library for React---which I hadn't used before and really liked!

I made it as an exercise to learn more about serverless functions---taking advantage of the twitter search python code I had written and covered previously in [this spanish post](/scraping-twitter-with-python). This was my first time making/deploying serverless functions (outside of following along a tutorial), and was very keen to see how I could use them to integrate Python code---which I'm most familiar with and would like to continue using for data science stuff---with frontend development frameworks like React and the JAMstack in general. The process was made pretty smooth thanks to [the python-lambda package](https://github.com/nficano/python-lambda), and my only struggle was figuring out the CORS issues (short story: handle OPTIONS pre-flight request as part of the function's logic). You can see the code for the lambda functoin in [this repo](https://github.com/jcaguirre89/twitter-scrape-lambda).

I then deployed this with the AWS API Gateway, so that I'd had a URL endpoint I could send HTTP requests to run the code, and turned _that_ into a GraphQL node with Apollo server as show in my [other previous post (also in spanish)](/rest-graphql-apollo) so that I could use the Apollo client to query the data and I also "protect" the URL endpoint. I'd like to make a follow up post to this one with the "making off', so stay tuned!

I think there's a lot of cool stuff you can do with this approach, and I'm interested to hear your opinions in the comments. I'd like to train a text classifier with [spaCy](https://spacy.io), something like giving users the ability to search for a term and have the model classify the results into buckets like positive-neutral-negative, politics-sports-tech-other, etc. I don't think it would take much more than what I did here, besides spending a couple hours hand labeling tweets 🤯.

Tell me what you think!
